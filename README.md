#  SQL Alchemy Challenge

This homework was completed as part of a team effort between Carmen Wiggens, Haritha Koleti, Michelle Petras, and Kathleen Sndier-Belinski (me), with some assistance from TA Sheri Rosalia.  Google was also our friend.

For this project, we will analyze climate data for an upcoming trip to Honolulu, Hawaii.  Data files were received in the form of .csv files,  hawaii_measurements.csv and hawaii_stations.csv, and a sqlite database file called hawii.slqlite and are in the \Resources folder.

Two resulting files were created:
climate_starter.ipynb (Jupiter notebook) that showed us the various data points we needed.
app.py (python) allowed us to create an interactive web page with the data points we wanted.
